        Make an HTML5 page with a menu containing at least 3 items. One leading
        to another HTML5 page with some personal info you want to share. Another
        leading to a page with a CV of exams qualifying you for where you are
        now, and a third with a description of your leisure activities, such as
        sky diving, marathoning, mountain climbing or whatever you do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make a git repo in that directory. Stage the files. Make a screen dump
        of the output of the git status command.

        Commit your work. Make another screen dump of the output of the git
        status command. Stage the two screen dumps, recommit, and submit the url
        of the repo.
